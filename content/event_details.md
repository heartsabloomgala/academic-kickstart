All paddles up show their numbered paddle and their generous hearts!  This very special event involves the auctioneer and guests in a pledge opportunity to benefit Sacred Heart.  Dollar amounts will be announced, and should you choose to pledge that amount…Paddles Up!  Big-Hearted folks and exciting times!  Don’t be shy… PADDLES UP!

<div><b style="font-size:30px">Wine Pull</b></div>
This is a win-win opportunity!  Draw a pre-numbered cork and at the end of the night go to the Wine Tree to pull the wine bottle that matches the number on your cork.  The twist is that amidst the wine bottles on the Wine Tree, there are expensive wine bottles; as well as, some bottles with wine tasting gift cards, valued up to $400.  Corks may be bought at the Drink Ticket Tables.  Your generous hearts will help our cause and you won’t go home empty-handed!
